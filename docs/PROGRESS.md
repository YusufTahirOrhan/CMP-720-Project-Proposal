# Project Progress

## Current Phase

Phase 6 - VL LUT Runtime Integration

## Completed Tasks

- `T0001` - Repository analysis and documentation setup.
- `T0002` - Confirm repository contents, Noxim availability, and source-document availability.
- `T0003` - Establish baseline build command.
- `T0004` - Run baseline Noxim simulation.
- `T0005` - Map Noxim extension points.
- `T0006` - Design 2.5D router ID and coordinate mapping.
- `T0007` - Implement 2.5D topology construction.
- `T0008` - Add Vertical Link data model.
- `T0009` - Add Boundary Router Identification.
- `T0010` - Implement Fault Injection Manager.
- `T0011` - Add Fault Mask Validation.
- `T0012` - Design VN State Representation.
- `T0013` - Implement VN Assignment Rules.
- `T0014` - Enforce VN Transition Restrictions.
- `T0015` - Design Offline VL LUT Format.
- `T0016` - Implement Offline VL LUT Generator.
- `T0023` - Add or register the Noxim source tree.
- `T0024` - Decide Windows 11 development environment and persist paper reference.

DeFT VN assignment behavior, the first VN movement-transition restriction enforcement layer, the offline VL LUT schema, and the standalone offline VL LUT generator now exist for `DEFT_2_5D`. Runtime LUT loading/use, final DeFT route selection, experiment automation, and metrics tasks have not been implemented.

## In-Progress Tasks

- None.

## Blocked Tasks

- None.

## Last Validation Result

- T0016 Offline VL LUT Generator completed on 2026-05-07.
- Required startup reading was completed before task work: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/VALIDATION.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and `docs/PROMPTS.md`.
- Before implementation, `git status --short --branch` in the parent repository showed branch `feat/map-noxim-extension-points...origin/feat/map-noxim-extension-points` with no local file modifications.
- Before implementation, `git -c safe.directory=C:/Projects/CMP-720-Project-Proposal/external/noxim -C external/noxim status --short --branch` showed branch `feat/baseline-noxim...origin/feat/baseline-noxim` with no local file modifications.
- Source document availability was confirmed for `Extended_Proposal.pdf`, `Proposal.pdf`, and `docs/references/DeFT_A_Deadlock-Free_and_Fault-Tolerant_Routing_Algorithm_for_2.5D_Chiplet_Networks.pdf`.
- Short source-document checks found the Extended Proposal's offline VL-selection equations for load, load imbalance, Manhattan distance, total distance, `Cs`, and `rho = 0.01`.
- Short source-document checks found the original DeFT paper's design-time offline search across VL-fault scenarios, runtime lookup-table use, and requirement for two VL selections per inter-chiplet packet.
- Source inspection was limited to `external/noxim/src/DeftTopology.*`, `external/noxim/src/DeftFaultInjectionManager.*`, and `external/noxim/config_examples/deft_2_5d_topology.yaml`.
- T0016 added `external/noxim/other/deft_vl_lut_generator.py` as a standalone Python standard-library generator that emits `deft_vl_lut.v1`.
- The generator mirrors current `DEFT_2_5D` topology constants and physical VL IDs, validates connected-chiplet physical fault masks, and supports `--fault-mask`, `--faulty-vls`, and `--max-fault-count`.
- The generator uses exact dynamic programming over uniform unit-demand assignment states for the proposal's Manhattan-distance plus load-imbalance cost with default `rho = 0.01`.
- Assumption: Uniform unit inter-chiplet demand is used until traffic-profile-specific LUT generation is designed.
- Assumption: Because schema v1 has no `destination_router_id`, destination-entry selection applies the same objective to interposer contexts keyed by `(source_chiplet_id, source_router_id)` and destination-chiplet functional VL endpoints.
- `python -m py_compile external/noxim/other/deft_vl_lut_generator.py` completed with exit code `0`.
- The generator CLI help command completed with exit code `0`.
- Deterministic in-memory generation for masks `0x0000` and `0x1111` completed with exit code `0`; repeated output matched, SHA-256 was `05c8cf1ce081a505e58cfa91c0e24bf53e144298119dddd530e42bd218bbdee7`, entry count was 384, selected VLs excluded faulty VLs, and selected VLs appeared first in `ranked_vl_ids`.
- The invalid-mask command `--fault-mask 0x000f` rejected the mask because it disconnects chiplet 0.
- `git diff --check` in the parent repository completed with exit code `0`.
- `git -c safe.directory=C:/Projects/CMP-720-Project-Proposal/external/noxim -C external/noxim diff --check` completed with exit code `0`.
- Before documentation updates, parent status showed only the submodule changed because of the new untracked generator file, and submodule status showed `?? other/deft_vl_lut_generator.py`.
- ADR-0027 records the durable decision to implement the LUT generator as a standalone Noxim helper.
- Blocked: Runtime LUT loading, route-data intermediate-destination state, final VL selection behavior, exact missing-entry handling, traffic-profile-specific LUT generation, physical-vs-directional experiment percentage accounting, experiment automation, and metrics remain future work.
- No Noxim C++/SystemC source files, simulator runtime behavior, route selection, metrics, experiment automation, simulations, regression commands, golden regression outputs, or DeFT performance experiments were changed or run.

External source tree registered during `T0023`:

- `external/noxim` - Noxim submodule and modifiable project fork from `https://github.com/YusufTahirOrhan/noxim`.

## Current Assumptions

- Assumption: `Extended_Proposal.pdf` is the primary technical source.
- Assumption: The original DeFT paper is the primary algorithmic reference for DeFT routing, VN rules, and VL selection.
- Assumption: The local ignored paper copy at `docs/references/DeFT_A_Deadlock-Free_and_Fault-Tolerant_Routing_Algorithm_for_2.5D_Chiplet_Networks.pdf` is available in this workspace for future DeFT-specific tasks.
- Assumption: `Proposal.pdf` is initial context only.
- Assumption: The peer evaluation document is unrelated and out of scope.
- Assumption: `external/noxim` is the baseline Noxim source tree and modifiable project fork to use for future explicit Noxim implementation tasks.
- Assumption: Noxim source should remain in the `external/noxim` submodule and should not be vendored directly into the main repository.
- Assumption: Noxim source files should not be modified during documentation and baseline-discovery tasks.
- Assumption: The baseline build command is `./build.sh` from `external/noxim`, validated in WSL Ubuntu on 2026-05-05.
- Assumption: WSL Ubuntu is the recommended environment for Noxim builds, regressions, and simulation runs on this Windows 11 machine.
- Assumption: Noxim build scripts and Makefiles should remain LF-normalized for WSL.
- Assumption: The local backup archives under `external/noxim/other/deps-backup` can support dependency setup for SystemC and yaml-cpp in the current WSL environment.
- Assumption: Supplying `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the local SystemC shared library is an environment setup requirement for the current WSL run, not a simulator behavior change.
- Assumption: The documented Noxim User Guide short deterministic example is suitable as the initial smoke baseline simulation command.
- Assumption: The implementation target remains a 4-chiplet 2.5D system with 4x4 mesh chiplets and four Vertical Links per chiplet.
- Assumption: Future DeFT configuration should be routed through `external/noxim/src/ConfigurationManager.*` and `external/noxim/src/GlobalParams.*`.
- Assumption: Future 2.5D topology work should start from `external/noxim/src/NoC.*`, `external/noxim/src/Tile.h`, `external/noxim/src/Router.*`, and the direction/VC structures in `external/noxim/src/GlobalParams.h` and `external/noxim/src/DataStructs.h`.
- Assumption: Future DeFT routing should use Noxim's registered routing-algorithm surface unless the next design tasks identify a safer, narrower integration point.
- Assumption: The initial 2.5D topology mapping uses a 2x2 chiplet grid, a 4x4 local mesh per chiplet, an 8x8 active-interposer footprint, chiplet router IDs `0..63`, and interposer router IDs `64..127`.
- Assumption: Packet source and final destination IDs remain chiplet router IDs only; interposer router IDs are internal transit IDs.
- Assumption: A physical bidirectional VL is identified separately from its two directional channels or endpoint directions.
- Assumption: Future 2.5D implementation should use a layer-aware mapping helper rather than relying on Noxim's mesh-only `id2Coord()` and `Router::getNeighborId()` behavior for all router IDs.
- Assumption: T0007's `DeftTopology` helper is the starting layer-aware mapping surface for future topology, VL, and boundary-router work.
- Assumption: T0007's `DIRECTION_HUB` wiring is a temporary physical carrier for VL construction only; final DeFT Up/Down movement semantics remain a future decision.
- Assumption: T0008 centralizes physical VL state in `external/noxim/src/DeftTopology.*`; future fault injection and routing tasks should reuse this surface instead of introducing a parallel VL inventory.
- Assumption: T0009 derives boundary-router identity from the centralized VL inventory; future DeFT routing, VN, and VL LUT tasks should use the boundary-router query surface instead of introducing a parallel boundary-router endpoint table.
- Assumption: A Vertical Link is represented as one physical bidirectional connection with one mutable functional state by default.
- Assumption: Directional VL channel accounting can be derived later if needed, but it should not replace the physical VL identity model without a new decision.
- Assumption: T0008 structural validation checks the VL inventory; T0011 fault-mask validation checks explicit and generated masks against the current physical VL model before startup fault state is applied.
- Assumption: The construction-only `DEFT_2_5D` smoke configuration is valid for topology instantiation checks, but not for DeFT performance evaluation because it intentionally generates no packets.
- Assumption: Future tasks must continue on the existing Git branch by default; Codex must not create or switch task branches unless the user explicitly asks for that operation.
- Assumption: T0010 fault configuration is counted over the current 16 physical bidirectional VLs. Final percentage conversion and directional VL accounting remain future work.
- Assumption: Startup fault state is metadata for future routing and LUT tasks in T0010; physical VL wiring is still constructed for all VLs, and route selection does not yet avoid faulty VLs.
- Assumption: T0011 treats four faulty physical bidirectional VLs out of 16 as the current physical 25% validation target for inspectability only.
- Assumption: T0011 does not resolve final percentage conversion or directional VL accounting for experiment automation.
- Assumption: T0012 maps DeFT VN state directly to Noxim VC IDs: VC 0 is VN.0 and VC 1 is VN.1 for DeFT-enabled runs.
- Assumption: T0013 treats `DEFT_2_5D` as the current DeFT-enabled mode and requires exactly two configured VCs for that topology.
- Assumption: A separate packet/flit `vn_id` field is unnecessary and should not be added unless future implementation proves the existing `vc_id` cannot safely carry DeFT VN state.
- Assumption: T0013's output-VC-aware reservation and forwarding path is the required foundation for safe VN reassignment; changing only `Flit::vc_id` without matching downstream full-status checks would be unsafe.
- Assumption: T0014 uses `DIRECTION_HUB` only as the current physical VL traversal carrier and derives Up/Down semantics from `DeftTopology` layer and boundary-router context.
- Assumption: T0014 does not need additional packet/flit movement-history metadata because the current input port is sufficient for the enforced Up-to-Horizontal and Horizontal-to-Down restrictions.
- Assumption: T0015 schema v1 uses a restricted deterministic YAML format named `deft_vl_lut.v1`.
- Assumption: T0015 keys runtime LUT entries by physical fault mask, source chiplet ID, source router ID, and destination chiplet ID.
- Assumption: T0015 uses a quoted fixed-width hexadecimal `fault_mask_id` over current physical bidirectional VL IDs `0..15`, where bit `vl_id` set means the physical VL is faulty.
- Assumption: T0015 stores paired `source_exit` and `destination_entry` selections because each inter-chiplet packet needs one VL choice on the source chiplet and one destination-side entry choice from the interposer.
- Assumption: T0015 keeps `destination_router_id` out of schema v1; a future schema can add destination-router granularity only through a version bump or explicitly optional field.
- Assumption: T0015 includes the no-fault mask so 0% fault scenarios can use the same lookup path.
- Assumption: T0016 generator constants mirror the current `DeftTopology` model; a future topology change must update the generator or introduce a shared topology export.
- Assumption: T0016 uses uniform unit inter-chiplet demand until traffic-profile-specific LUT generation is designed.
- Assumption: T0016 uses an interposer-context destination-entry selection model because schema v1 has no `destination_router_id`.

## Open Questions

- For final experiment automation, should Vertical Link fault percentages be converted from physical bidirectional links or directional links?
- Are GEM5/PARSEC traces required for final delivery, or are synthetic traffic experiments sufficient?
- Should WSL be configured persistently with `ldconfig` for the local SystemC library, or should future Noxim runs keep using a per-process `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`?
- Should final DeFT routing keep using `DIRECTION_HUB` as the physical Vertical Link carrier, or introduce explicit semantic Up/Down ports after the LUT design is complete?
- Should a future `deft_vl_lut.v2` add `destination_router_id` for destination-router-granular entry VL optimization?
- How should final traffic-profile-specific LUT generation encode non-uniform `T_inter_r` inputs?
- Why did Git fail to create task branch refs in the current Windows worktree? This is no longer operationally important because user instruction now forbids automatic task branch creation.

## Next Recommended Task

Start `T0017` and load/use the generated `deft_vl_lut.v1` data at DeFT boundary-routing points.

## Next Ready-to-Send Prompt

```text
Start task T0017: Load and Use VL LUT at Boundary Routers.

Before starting, read AGENTS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/TASKS.md, docs/ROADMAP.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/VALIDATION.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, and docs/PROMPTS.md.

Continue on the existing Git branch. Do not create or switch task branches.

Use the registered Noxim source tree at:
external/noxim

`external/noxim` is the Noxim submodule and modifiable project fork from:
https://github.com/YusufTahirOrhan/noxim

T0007 added selectable `DEFT_2_5D` topology construction and the `DeftTopology` mapping helper. T0008 centralized the physical Vertical Link model and functional state. T0009 added the derived boundary-router inventory. T0010 added startup-time permanent physical VL fault injection. T0011 added focused explicit/generated fault-mask validation and inspectability against the current 16 physical bidirectional VL model. T0012 mapped DeFT VN state directly onto Noxim VC IDs. T0013 implemented VN assignment and output-VC-aware reservation/forwarding. T0014 added DeFT-only VN transition-restriction filtering without packet/flit movement-history metadata. T0015 designed the offline VL LUT format: `deft_vl_lut.v1`, keyed by physical fault-mask bitset, source chiplet ID, source router ID, and destination chiplet ID, with paired `source_exit` and `destination_entry` values over current physical VL IDs. T0016 added `external/noxim/other/deft_vl_lut_generator.py`, a standalone deterministic generator for the T0015 schema using Manhattan distance plus load imbalance with `rho = 0.01`.

Goal: implement the smallest focused runtime loading and use path for `deft_vl_lut.v1` at DeFT boundary-routing points. Boundary routers should select functional source-exit and destination-entry Vertical Links using the current startup fault vector and the schema-v1 lookup key. Preserve existing baseline routing behavior outside `DEFT_2_5D`.

Keep this task independent from experiment automation, metrics changes, golden regression output updates, and DeFT performance experiments. Do not change the T0016 generator format unless source inspection proves a narrow compatibility fix is required. If route-data intermediate-destination state is needed, keep it minimal and document why before editing.

Use `Extended_Proposal.pdf` as the primary project requirements source and the original DeFT paper at `docs/references/DeFT_A_Deadlock-Free_and_Fault-Tolerant_Routing_Algorithm_for_2.5D_Chiplet_Networks.pdf` as the primary algorithmic reference. Use `Proposal.pdf` only as initial context. Ignore the peer evaluation document completely.

Before coding, produce a short implementation plan. Work only on the selected runtime LUT loading/use task. Do not modify unrelated files. Clearly mark assumptions as `Assumption` and blockers as `Blocked`.

Use only known validation commands. If build-integrated Noxim C++ changes are made, use the documented `./build.sh` from `external/noxim` in WSL Ubuntu and the existing construction-only no-traffic smoke only when the invocation remains valid. Do not invent simulator commands. Do not use `./regression.sh --update`.

Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/TASKS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/VALIDATION.md, and docs/PROMPTS.md with the result. If a durable implementation decision becomes clear, update docs/DECISIONS.md too.
