## In-Progress Tasks

- None.

## Blocked Tasks

- None.

## Last Validation Result

- T0008 Vertical Link data-model validation completed on 2026-05-06.
- Required startup reading was completed before task work: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/VALIDATION.md`, and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Before implementation, `git status --short` in the parent repository showed unrelated untracked `.vs/`; this task did not modify it.
- Before implementation, `git -c safe.directory=C:/Projects/CMP-720-Project-Proposal/external/noxim -C external/noxim status --short` returned no output.
- `Extended_Proposal.pdf`, `Proposal.pdf`, and `docs/references/DeFT_A_Deadlock-Free_and_Fault-Tolerant_Routing_Algorithm_for_2.5D_Chiplet_Networks.pdf` were confirmed present.
- Short PDF text checks with the bundled Python runtime and `pypdf` confirmed source occurrences for chiplets, active interposers, Vertical Links, boundary routers, and bidirectional VLs. No extracted text files were created.
- T0008 extended `external/noxim/src/DeftTopology.*` into the centralized Vertical Link model/query surface for the deterministic 16 physical bidirectional VLs.
- The model now provides default functional state, `resetVerticalLinkStates()`, `setVerticalLinkFunctional()`, `isVerticalLinkFunctional()`, functional-link queries per chiplet, bidirectional endpoint lookup, chiplet/interposer endpoint lookup, and `validateVerticalLinkModel()`.
- Structural validation covers stable VL IDs, chiplet ownership, slots, unique endpoints, same-footprint chiplet/interposer endpoint pairing, and exactly four VLs per chiplet.
- `NoC::buildDeft2D()` validates the VL model before wiring the physical links and prints `functional=true` for all default VL endpoint records.
- Assumption: A Vertical Link remains modeled as one physical bidirectional connection with one functional/faulty state. Directional VL accounting, if needed for paper alignment, remains a future derived view.
- Assumption: `validateVerticalLinkModel()` is structural inventory validation, not fault-mask validation.
- Blocked: Explicit `DIRECTION_UP` and `DIRECTION_DOWN` semantics remain undecided for future DeFT routing and VN-transition tasks.
- The final documented build command `./build.sh` from `external/noxim` completed with exit code `0` in WSL Ubuntu.
- The build emitted only pre-existing Noxim warnings.
- The first construction smoke attempt from the sandbox failed with WSL access denied; the same documented command was rerun with approved WSL escalation and completed successfully.
- The final construction smoke command completed with exit code `0`: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/c/Projects/CMP-720-Project-Proposal/external/noxim/bin/libs/systemc-2.3.1/lib-linux64 ./noxim -config ../config_examples/deft_2_5d_topology.yaml -seed 0 -sim 20 -warmup 0`.
- Construction smoke output reported `chiplet_routers=64`, `interposer_routers=64`, `total_routers=128`, `chiplet_cardinal_links=96`, `interposer_cardinal_links=112`, and `vertical_links=16`.
- The smoke output printed all 16 expected VL endpoint records, from `vl_id=0` endpoint `1 -> 65` through `vl_id=15` endpoint `52 -> 116`, each with `functional=true`.
- The construction smoke intentionally used no traffic, so it reported zero received packets and zero received flits. The `-nan` average-delay and wireless-utilization values are expected for a no-packet construction smoke and are not experiment results.
- `git -c safe.directory=C:/Projects/CMP-720-Project-Proposal/external/noxim -C external/noxim diff --check` completed with exit code `0`.
- No startup-time fault injection behavior, fault-mask generation, fault-rate configuration, DeFT routing behavior, VN behavior, VL LUT generation, experiment automation, metrics change, golden regression output update, or DeFT experiment was run.

External source tree registered during `T0023`:

- `external/noxim` - Noxim submodule and modifiable project fork from `https://github.com/YusufTahirOrhan/noxim`.

## Current Assumptions

- Assumption: `Extended_Proposal.pdf` is the primary technical source.
- Assumption: The original DeFT paper is the primary algorithmic reference for DeFT routing, VN rules, and VL selection.
- Assumption: The local ignored paper copy at `docs/references/DeFT_A_Deadlock-Free_and_Fault-Tolerant_Routing_Algorithm_for_2.5D_Chiplet_Networks.pdf` is available in this workspace for future DeFT-specific tasks.
- Assumption: `Proposal.pdf` is initial context only.
- Assumption: The peer evaluation document is unrelated and out of scope.
- Assumption: `external/noxim` is the baseline Noxim source tree and modifiable project fork to use for future explicit Noxim implementation tasks.
- Assumption: Noxim source should remain in the `external/noxim` submodule and should not be vendored directly into the main repository.
- Assumption: Noxim source files should not be modified during documentation and baseline-discovery tasks.
- Assumption: The baseline build command is `./build.sh` from `external/noxim`, validated in WSL Ubuntu on 2026-05-05.
- Assumption: WSL Ubuntu is the recommended environment for Noxim builds, regressions, and simulation runs on this Windows 11 machine.
- Assumption: Noxim build scripts and Makefiles should remain LF-normalized for WSL.
- Assumption: The local backup archives under `external/noxim/other/deps-backup` can support dependency setup for SystemC and yaml-cpp in the current WSL environment.
- Assumption: Supplying `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the local SystemC shared library is an environment setup requirement for the current WSL run, not a simulator behavior change.
- Assumption: The documented Noxim User Guide short deterministic example is suitable as the initial smoke baseline simulation command.
- Assumption: The implementation target remains a 4-chiplet 2.5D system with 4x4 mesh chiplets and four Vertical Links per chiplet.
- Assumption: Future DeFT configuration should be routed through `external/noxim/src/ConfigurationManager.*` and `external/noxim/src/GlobalParams.*`.
- Assumption: Future 2.5D topology work should start from `external/noxim/src/NoC.*`, `external/noxim/src/Tile.h`, `external/noxim/src/Router.*`, and the direction/VC structures in `external/noxim/src/GlobalParams.h` and `external/noxim/src/DataStructs.h`.
- Assumption: Future DeFT routing should use Noxim's registered routing-algorithm surface unless the next design tasks identify a safer, narrower integration point.
- Assumption: The initial 2.5D topology mapping uses a 2x2 chiplet grid, a 4x4 local mesh per chiplet, an 8x8 active-interposer footprint, chiplet router IDs `0..63`, and interposer router IDs `64..127`.
- Assumption: Packet source and final destination IDs remain chiplet router IDs only; interposer router IDs are internal transit IDs.
- Assumption: A physical bidirectional VL is identified separately from its two directional channels or endpoint directions.
- Assumption: Future 2.5D implementation should use a layer-aware mapping helper rather than relying on Noxim's mesh-only `id2Coord()` and `Router::getNeighborId()` behavior for all router IDs.
- Assumption: T0007's `DeftTopology` helper is the starting layer-aware mapping surface for future topology, VL, and boundary-router work.
- Assumption: T0007's `DIRECTION_HUB` wiring is a temporary physical carrier for VL construction only; final DeFT Up/Down movement semantics remain a future decision.
- Assumption: T0008 centralizes physical VL state in `external/noxim/src/DeftTopology.*`; future fault injection and routing tasks should reuse this surface instead of introducing a parallel VL inventory.
- Assumption: A Vertical Link is represented as one physical bidirectional connection with one mutable functional state by default.
- Assumption: Directional VL channel accounting can be derived later if needed, but it should not replace the physical VL identity model without a new decision.
- Assumption: T0008 structural validation is not fault-mask validation; no-chiplet-disconnected checks remain a future fault-validation task.
- Assumption: The construction-only `DEFT_2_5D` smoke configuration is valid for topology instantiation checks, but not for DeFT performance evaluation because it intentionally generates no packets.
- Assumption: Future tasks must continue on the existing Git branch by default; Codex must not create or switch task branches unless the user explicitly asks for that operation.

## Open Questions

- Should Vertical Link fault percentages be counted over physical bidirectional links or directional links?
- Are GEM5/PARSEC traces required for final delivery, or are synthetic traffic experiments sufficient?
- Should WSL be configured persistently with `ldconfig` for the local SystemC library, or should future Noxim runs keep using a per-process `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`?
- What exact algorithmic representation should carry chiplet-to-interposer Down movement and interposer-to-chiplet Up movement in DeFT routing and VN-transition logic?
- Which packet, flit, or route metadata fields should carry DeFT layer/VN context without disrupting baseline routing behavior?
- Why did Git fail to create task branch refs in the current Windows worktree? This is no longer operationally important because user instruction now forbids automatic task branch creation.

## Next Recommended Task

Start `T0009` and add the smallest boundary-router identification/query surface needed by future DeFT routing tasks, building on the T0008 centralized VL model without changing route selection.

## Next Ready-to-Send Prompt

```text
Start task T0009: Add Boundary Router Identification.

Before starting, read AGENTS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/TASKS.md, docs/ROADMAP.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/VALIDATION.md, and docs/DECISIONS.md.

Continue on the existing Git branch. Do not create or switch task branches.

Use the registered Noxim source tree at:
external/noxim

`external/noxim` is the Noxim submodule and modifiable project fork from:
https://github.com/YusufTahirOrhan/noxim

T0007 added selectable `DEFT_2_5D` topology construction, the `DeftTopology` mapping helper, four isolated 4x4 chiplet meshes, an 8x8 active-interposer mesh, and the deterministic 16-VL endpoint table. T0008 extended `DeftTopology` into the centralized physical Vertical Link model/query surface with stable VL IDs, chiplet ownership, slots, chiplet/interposer endpoints, default functional state, functional-state query/mutation helpers, and structural VL validation. The construction smoke config is:
external/noxim/config_examples/deft_2_5d_topology.yaml

Goal: add the smallest boundary-router identification/query surface needed after T0008. Represent each chiplet boundary router with stable router ID, owner chiplet, local coordinate, VL slot, attached VL ID, and attached interposer endpoint. Keep the model inspectable and reusable by later DeFT routing and VN tasks.

Keep this task independent from startup-time fault injection behavior, fault-mask generation, fault-rate configuration, DeFT routing behavior, route selection, VN assignment behavior, VN transition restrictions, VL LUT generation, experiment automation, metrics changes, and golden regression output updates.

Known result so far: T0007 already added `DeftTopology::isBoundaryRouter(id)`, `RouterInfo::boundary_router`, and VL endpoint lookup. T0008 added centralized VL state and endpoint queries. T0009 should decide whether those existing surfaces are sufficient or whether a small explicit boundary-router inventory/query contract is needed. Do not duplicate data unnecessarily.

Use `Extended_Proposal.pdf` as the primary project requirements source and the original DeFT paper at `docs/references/DeFT_A_Deadlock-Free_and_Fault-Tolerant_Routing_Algorithm_for_2.5D_Chiplet_Networks.pdf` as the primary algorithmic reference. Use `Proposal.pdf` only as initial context. Ignore the peer evaluation document completely.

Before coding, produce a short implementation plan. Work only on the selected boundary-router identification task. Do not modify unrelated files. Clearly mark assumptions as `Assumption` and blockers as `Blocked`.

Use only known validation commands. The baseline build command is documented as `./build.sh` from `external/noxim` in WSL Ubuntu. The construction smoke command is documented in `docs/VALIDATION.md`; only run a simulation if the task preserves the construction-only no-traffic invocation or provides another clearly valid invocation. Do not use `./regression.sh --update`.

Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/TASKS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/VALIDATION.md, and docs/PROMPTS.md with the result. If a durable implementation decision becomes clear, update docs/DECISIONS.md too.
